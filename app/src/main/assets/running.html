        Whenever I run in the morning, I always feel like I gained a couple of hours during the day. Research has actually shown that runners who run in the morning are more consistent with their running than those who try to do it later on.
        And since most races are run in the morning, it's good to practice your morning run routine before a big race.
        If you want to become a morning runner, here are some tips to make running in the morning easier:

    <h2>1.Get to bed early.</h2>

        </p>

        <p  align="justify">A morning running habit starts with proper planning the night before. Some people think they can watch late-night TV and still get up early for a run.
            Do yourself a favor –- DVR your favorite late TV shows and plan to get to bed in time to guarantee yourself 7-8 hours of sleep.
            Once you've done a couple of morning runs, you'll start to get more tired at night, so it will be easier to get to bed early.

    <h2>2.Sleep in your running clothes.

    </h2>

        <p align="justify">
            It hard to blow off a run when you're already dressed for it! This trick may seem a little silly, but runners who have tried it say that it works. Of course, don't sleep with your running shoes on -- those you'll have to put on once you get out of bed.

<div>
    <h2>3.Or, lay out your clothes.</h2>

    <div >
        <p align="justify">
            If you don't feel like sleeping in your clothes, at least lay them out, all ready to go. Having your clothes right there will make it easier to get dressed to run. Some runners even like to put their clothes in the bathroom, which forces them to wake up a little and then get dressed. (Added bonus: If you have a snoozing spouse next to you, he or she will appreciate not being disturbed.)

    <h2>
        4.Put your alarm clock out of reach.

    </h2>

        </p>
        <p align="justify">
            When that alarm goes off early in the morning, it's tempting to keep hitting the snooze button and skip your running plans. But if your alarm clock is across the room, you're already out of bed and a lot less likely to say, "Just 10 more minutes…"

        5.Think about your plan the night before.

        </p>
        <p align="justify">
        <p>Plan out your morning run the night before -- how far, for how long, what course you'll run. Put it in your calendar, if that helps you stay on track. Doing so will help you get more motivated for your run and ensure that you have enough time for your run before you start the rest of your day.

        6.Get a morning running buddy.

        <p align="justify">
        <p>If you usually run by yourself, try to recruit a running friend to meet you in the morning. Or, <a href="https://www.verywell.com/how-to-find-a-running-group-2911226" >find a running group</a> that meets in the morning. You'll be less likely to skip your run if you know people are waiting for you.

        </p>
        <p align="justify">
        <p>It's never good to run on an empty stomach, but you most likely won't have a lot of extra time to eat and then digest your food. So, try eating something small like an energy bar or a banana, so you're not running on empty.</p><p>More: <a href="https://www.verywell.com/should-i-eat-before-a-run-2911547" >Should I Eat Before I Run?</a>

        8.Wear reflective gear.

        </p>
        <p align="justify">
        <p>It's important to stay safe and make sure you're seen when running in the dark or low-light conditions. If you're running in the early morning, wear white, yellow, or orange clothes. Also, make sure you have <a href="https://www.verywell.com/reflective-gear-for-running-at-night-2911390" >reflective gear</a> on. Although some items (running shoes, jackets) already have reflective pieces on them, it doesn't hurt to add more.

        <p>You're most likely going to wake up dehydrated, so make sure you drink about 6-8 ounces of water before you start your run.
