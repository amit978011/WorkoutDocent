    Starchy foods often need to be limited if you're following a low-carb diet. However, the U.S. Department of Agriculture recommends you fill one-fourth of your plate with these foods at each meal since they provide essential nutrients. Starchy foods, sometimes called complex carbohydrates, include grains, beans and legumes and starchy vegetables.

    Foods in this group include pasta, breads, popcorn, crackers, tortillas, cereals, rice, oatmeal, barley, millet and other grains. Breads and grains provide you with fiber, B vitamins, iron, selenium and magnesium, especially if you choose the healthier whole-grain versions of these foods, which may lower your risk for heart disease and constipation and help you manage your weight.

<h2 style="color:orange">Starchy Vegetables</h2>

    Starchy vegetables include peas, corn, potatoes, cassava, taro, water chestnuts, plantains, green bananas and lima beans. While they shouldn't be the only vegetables you eat, these vegetables can help you meet your recommended nutrient intake for a number of nutrients, including fiber, potassium and vitamins A and C, potentially lowering your risk for high blood pressure and high cholesterol.

<h2 style="color:orange">Beans and Other Legumes</h2>

    Beans and other legumes have the distinction of counting as both starchy foods and protein foods. These include lentils, kidney beans, black-eyed peas, chickpeas, black beans, white beans, pinto beans and any other types of dried beans. Eating these foods will help you increase your protein, fiber, zinc, iron, potassium and folate intake.
