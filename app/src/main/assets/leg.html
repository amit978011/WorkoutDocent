<h2 style="color:red">The 7 Best Legs Exercises for You</h2>
<hr size="4px" style="color:red">
<div align="center">
    <h3 align ="center">Barbell Squat</h3>
    <img src="file:///android_asset/leg1.jpg" width="100%" height="auto"  >
    <h6 align="justify"> Stand with your feet about shoulder-width apart and hold a bar across your upper back. Your knees should be slightly bent and your toes turned out slightly. Keeping your head in a neutral position, abs tight and torso upright, bend at the knees and hips to slowly lower your body as if you were going to sit in a chair. Go as deep as you can handle, ideally to a point where your thighs come parallel to the floor or below while maintaining your natural lower-back arch, then forcefully drive through your heels and extend your hips and knees to return to a standing position.</h6>

<div align="center">
    <h3 align ="center">Front Squat</h3>
    <img src="file:///android_asset/leg2.jpg" width="100%" height="auto"  >
    <h6 align="justify"> Set the pegs in a power rack just at or below mid-chest, and place the safety bars at a level between your hips and knees. Step up to the bar, crossing your arms to build a shelf to cradle it at your front delts and upper chest. Keep your chest up, lower back and abs tight, and eyes forward as you step back into a shoulder-width stance. Bend your knees and hips as if sitting in a chair until your thighs are at least parallel to the floor, then reverse direction by driving through your heels and pressing your hips forward to return to standing. “Keep your neck and back straight and elbows lifted high throughout the lift,” Kirchofner instructs. “Inhale to support the trunk and abdomen at the start of your descent, and keep your core and abdomen engaged to help minimize stress on your lower lumbar area.”</h6></div>

    <h3 align ="center">Romanian Deadlift</h3>
    <img src="file:///android_asset/leg3.jpg" width="100%" height="auto"  >
    <h6 align="justify"> Stand upright holding a barbell in front of your upper thighs with an overhand grip. Place your feet shoulder-width apart and slightly bend your knees. With your chest up, arms straight and core tight to maintain the natural arch in your low back, lean forward from your hips, pushing them rearward until your torso is roughly parallel to the floor or until you feel a good stretch in your hamstrings. At the bottom, keep your back flat and head neutral. The bar should be very close to or in contact with your legs throughout. Flex your hamstrings and glutes to reverse the motion, bringing the bar back to the start position. “The movement should come from the hips extending — pushing your hips forward — not from extending the lower back,” Flores says. “In other words, don’t lead the lift with your chest, arms and back.”
    </h6></div>
<hr size="4px" style="color:red">
<div align="center">
    <h3 align ="center">Hack Squat</h3>
    <img src="file:///android_asset/leg4.jpg" width="100%" height="auto"  >
    <h6 align="justify"> Step inside a hack squat machine, placing your shoulders and back against the pads. Set your feet at mid-platform just inside shoulder width, keeping your feet flat throughout the exercise. With your chest up and core tight, unhook the safeties and slowly lower yourself, stopping when your thighs are just past parallel to the platform. From here, powerfully press upward to the start position, keeping your knees bent slightly at the top to protect them from hyperextension. “When performing any squat movement, my cues are always to avoid any excessive internal or external rotation at the knees — think the ‘knock-knee’ position or knees and toes pointing out — along with keeping your knees about shoulder-width apart throughout the movement,” Flores instructs. “The weight should be felt in your heels, not your toes.”

<div align="center">
    <h3 align ="center">Walking Lunge</h3>
    <img src="file:///android_asset/leg5.jpg" width="100%" height="auto"  >
    <h6 align="justify">Holding dumbbells in each hand, step forward with one foot. Bend both knees to lower your torso toward the floor, making sure your front knee doesn’t pass your toes at the bottommost position. Stop just short of your rear knee touching the floor, then drive through the heel of your front foot while bringing your rear leg forward until you return to a standing position. Then step with the opposite leg into a lunge, repeating the pattern. Continue alternating down the floor. “The cues I utilize when teaching this movement are to always have your core engaged, with a neutral spine or slight lordosis (extension),” Flores says. “Most important, do not let the front knee turn in or out excessively.”

<div align="center">
    <h3 align ="center">Pistol Squat</h3>
    <img src="file:///android_asset/leg6.jpg" width="100%" height="auto"  >
    <h6 align="justify">Begin in a standing position. Extend one leg straight out in front of you, balancing on your other foot. From here, squat all the way down by lowering your hips and glutes straight toward the floor, bending your knee until your working thigh is below parallel. At the bottom, your nonworking leg and arms will be out in front of you for balance with your planted foot flat on the floor. Drive through that heel to return to a standing position, making sure to never let that heel come up as you rep.  </h6></div>
<div align="center">
    <hr size="4px" style="color:red">
<h3 align ="center">Step-Up</h3>
<img src="file:///android_asset/leg7.jpg" width="100%" height="auto"  >
<h6 align="justify"> Hold a dumbbell in each hand in front of a knee- to hip-high step, bench or platform. Starting with your feet in a shoulder-width stance, step forward with one leg onto the platform and drive through that thigh to propel your body upward. Bring your trailing leg up and stand atop the platform, then step back with either leg to return to the floor. You can either repeat with the same leading leg for all reps and then switch or alternate your lead leg from step to step.</h6></div>
<hr size="4px" style="color:red">
<div align="center">
    <h3 align ="center">Leg Press</h3>
    <img src="file:///android_asset/leg10.jpg" width="100%" height="auto"  >
    <h6 align="justify"> Sit squarely in the leg press machine and place your feet shoulder-width apart on the sled. Keeping your chest up and lower back pressed into the pad, carefully unlatch the sled from the safeties. Bend your knees to lower the platform, stopping before your glutes lift off the pad. From there, powerfully extend your knees to press the weight up (but don’t lock them out at the top).
